# Drosophila - Carleton University Theme for Drupal 7

Based on the excellent [Adaptive Theme](https://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme).

Important notes:

'Leaderboard-Left' must be in the leaderboard region.

The main menu must be in the leaderboard region. 

'Secondary Menu to Hamburger' must be in the header region. 

'Secondary Menu to Leaderboard Left' must be in the header region. 

This theme relies on the above hardcoded menu/block names. 

It also requires menu blocks in the header to be in this order: 

Secondary Menu To Leaderboard Left	
 
Secondary Menu to Hamburger	
 
Secondary Menu	
 
Search form
